## Hydrocyclone
A hydrocyclone (often referred to by the shortened form cyclone) is a device to classify,separate or sort particles in a liquid suspension based on the ratio of their centripetal force to fluid resistance.This ratio is high for dense (where separation by density is required) and coarse (where separation by size is required) particles,and low for light and fine particles.Computer Simulation of Water Oil Separation in Cylindrical.Abstract Computational Fluid Dynamics is employed to predict the efficiency of separation of water oil mixtures in cylindrical and square hydrocyclones.Computer simulations are conducted using the Large Eddy Simulation model for turbulence.Mass
