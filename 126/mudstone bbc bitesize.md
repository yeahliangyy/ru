## Three Ways Sedimentary Rocks Are Formed Sciencing
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Sedimentary rocks form from the weathering of other rocks,dead organic remains or chemical precipitation.Processes used to form sedimentary rocks include classic sedimentation,chemical sedimentation and biochemical sedimentation.Examples of sedimentary rocks include shale,limestone and coal.Nasa's Curiosity Mars rover reaching turning point&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Image caption Hard granules give the mudstones a slightly bumpy appearance in places.The mission team also wants to take another look at an outcrop it has called Shaler.It is a classic example of cross stratification a structure produced from thin,inclined layers of sediment.Again,scientists made brief observations of the outcrop last year.

Sandstone forms over the course of centuries,as deposits of sand accumulate in rivers,lakes or on the ocean floor,and the sand blends with calcite or quarts and then undergoes compression.After enough time goes by,the pressure pushes all of these elements together to create sandstone.Because not all sand is identical but instead comes in.mudstone bbc bitesizemudstone is used for &#183; Best Answer: Mudstone is a commonly used term for a rock formed from a soft plastic silt clay mixture with more than half of its size fraction smaller than … &#187; More detailed Mudstone Wikipedia,the free encyclopedia.Get price

## Mudstone Uses Medical Architecture
Uses of Mudstone.Every rock is formed under different chemical,physical and biological conditions which results in formation of a wide and distinct group of minerals and hence they find applications in various fields.Rocks are hard,soft,permeable and impermeable.They are of various sizes and shapes,depending on the type of rock.GCSE Geography Coastline Features Caused by Coastal ErosionOne of the topics looked at in GCSE Geography is the features that are found on a coastline.This quiz focusses in particular on those features which are caused by coastal erosion.Over time the sea can wash away an entire coastline,forcing back human uses of that land (such as settlements or farms) and letting the sea encroach ever further.
