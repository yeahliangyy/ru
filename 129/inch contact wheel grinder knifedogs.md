## Drive Wheels &amp;amp; Rollers: Amazon.com
A contact wheel is used in abrasive belt machines such as a belt grinder or sander.Similar to the drive wheel,a drive roller transmits power from a shift to turn a belt system,but drive rollers are typically more compact and less disc shaped.In addition to drive rollers,other belt rollers are available,including tension rollers and idler.Contact WheelsRubber (neoprene or urethane) contact wheels come in many hardnesses to fit a variety of grinding and finishing needs.The face of rubber wheels can be shaped to aid in polishing recesses and radii.Neoprene wheels can also be serrated to increase cut rate and increase belt life.

&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;I think a WIP entitled &quot;How to order a contact wheel from Sunray for Surface Grinder conversion or Belt grinder&quot; would be a fantastic addition to the Articles section of your website or even a sticky right here on your forum as this question has been asked alot,lots of answers given,and I still have questions,LOL Thanks again JoshGrizzly G9242 Inch WheelThe Grizzly G9242 10 inch rubber cushioned wheel for the G1015 grinder fit the spindle tightly and has very little vibration.It takes some practice to compensate for the small amount of vibration and lateral belt slippage (minor) to get the right grind lines so there are no peaks and valleys in the length of your pull on the wheel.

Should I spend the money on a serrated wheel?

&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;I have my kmg and all but need to know what size contact wheels I need.I have a 10 inch now but what else do I need for sharping and handles and what not do do serrations in the contact wheel matter? Also I have a grizzly but found out tonight putting it together for the first time so key parts are missing so i decided to make it a buff.Dirt Cheap 2 x 72 Belt Grinder BuildDirt Cheap 2 x 72 Belt Grinder Build OK,I love belt grinders just as much as the next person,but it's a tough outlay of cash to get into a new grinder.It has to combine both a flat platen and a contact wheel.It has to use inexpensive,available parts and it has to be simple to put together without a welder.For the basic frame I.
