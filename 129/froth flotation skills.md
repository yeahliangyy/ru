## Froth flotation circuit design and basic testwork.
Froth flotation circuit design and basic testwork requirements.Froth flotation is a very important mineral concentration process that is used to recover a vast array of different minerals containing valuable commodities such as copper,lead,zinc,nickel,molybdenum,tungsten,silver,gold,phosphate and potash.In the flotation process,ore.Science in the art of flotation Froth cameras allow.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Science in the art of flotation Froth cameras allow operators to precisely monitor and analyze flotation.“An operator could look at the froth and tell you exactly what it was doing,but those skills have largely been lost,” says Michael Schaffer.

## Knowledge the Important of Flotation

## Tailings.info What are tailings?
Concentration is the process of extracting the economic product from the crushed and ground ore,the waste from this process is the tailings.Froth flotation (figure 2) is the most widely used concentration method and is normally the first step in the mineral processing sequence where chemical reagents are introduced (Vick 1990).Froth flotationFroth flotation is a selective process for separating minerals from gangue by using surfactants and wetting agents.The selective separation of the minerals makes processing complex (that is,mixed) ores economically feasible.The flotation process is used for the separation of a large range of sulfides,carbonates and oxides prior to further refinement.

## flotation process FactMonster
flotation process,in mineral treatment and mining,process for concentrating the metal bearing mineral in an ore.Crude ore is ground to a fine powder and mixed with water,frothing reagents,and collecting reagents.When air is blown through the mixture,mineral particles cling to the bubbles,which rise to form a froth on the surface.Calculation of the specific surface area in flotation.In froth flotation,for instance,the amount of water collect is intimately related to the amount of gangue collected,which in turn helps dictates the grade of the product obtained.This paper.
